# Template for my class sites

I've been pretty satisfied with this format for the past couple of years, but I just had the good sense to create a blank version so I don't need to copy, paste, delete every semester.

It's a bit wide for small screens, so you might want to tweak the CSS if that is a concern. No bells and whistles either, if that is your sort of thing!
