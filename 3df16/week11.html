            <h2>FINAL PROJECT (PROJECT DUE 12/06, PUBLIC PLAYTEST 12/13)</h2>
            <p>Working in groups of 6, you will prototype and complete a small, self-directed 3D game, or game level, in Unity. Details:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The emphasis should be on producing a well-designed and compelling game that is supported by its media.</li>
                <li>The type of game is your choice, as long as it remains relevant to the material covered in this class, is small in scope, and is represents the shared input of the team.</li>
                <li>Your team is responsible for determining team roles, delegating tasks each week, and meeting deadlines.</li>
                <li>Each game should include a start screen, instructions, game scene, and ending scene (at minimum).</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>HOMEWORK</h1>

            <h2>PROTOTYPE: ANIMATION TESTS (DUE START OF CLASS NEXT WEEK)</h2>
            <p>Work up two animation studies:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Controllable character</li>
                <li>Navmesh agent</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Technical requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>One general animation rig</li>
                <li>One humanoid animation rig</li>
                <li>One avatar should move through root motion</li>
                <li>One avatar should move through programmatic control</li>
                <li>There is no minimum requirement for animation clips, but please push yourself</li>
                <li>Create your own animations or retarget animation packs from mixamo.com or Asset Store</li>

                <li>A working title</li>
                <li>Clear description of the game's concept, theme, and goals.</li>
                <li>Describe your game's core mechanics through the use of compelling verbs. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AhRFBJNlC8">Verbs?</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVpjZlqoSOU">Good verbs?</a>)</li>
                <li>Core mechanics: Show two precedents which are successful &amp; relevant to your game.</li>
                <li>Concept Art &amp; Sketches: Show two examples of concept art which are representative of your game's visuals. Also include two reference/inspirational images.</li>
