            <h2>FINAL PROJECT: PROTOTYPE CORE MECHANICS</h2>
            <p>Next week, be prepared to demonstrate your core mechanics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>All expected core mechanics must be demonstrated next week</strong>.</li>
                <li>Develop core mechanics in a neutral scene to demonstrate feasibility/functionality</li>
                <li>Implement actual controls (WASD + Mouse? Gamepad? Other? Make sure it works as expected with your desired input)</li>
                <li>Use properly scaled placeholders for game objects</li>
                <li>Upload a copy of the project to your group's class Drive before 9 am.</li>
                <li>Research</li>

                <li>Detailed images of the UI for <em>all scenes</em> in your game</li>
                <li>These should be mocked up to show their position and scale onscreen.</li>
                <li>First pass at visuals and fonts (must be licensed or freely available)</li>
                <li>These can be static images created in Photoshop, Illustrator, etc. or Unity Canvas UI elements in placeholder scenes</li>
                <li>Upload digital copies to your group's class Drive before 9 am.</li>

                <li>Don't reinvent the wheel: Common flowchart shapes can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart#Building_blocks">here</a>.</li>
