            <h2>UNITY 3D: PROJECTILES, RAYCASTING, TERRAIN</h2>
            <p><strong>Demo project from class is available <a href="https://github.com/samsheffield/3D_Game_Design/releases/tag/fall16_3">here</a>.</strong> </p>

            <p>The demo will cover some introductory applications of raycasting, projectiles in 3D space as well as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adding basic jump control (added to FirstPersonController.cs)</li>
                <li>Hiding the cursor and locking it to the center of the window (added to MouseLook.cs)</li>
                <li>Linecasting vs Raycasting</li>
                <li>Update: Terrain omitted, see resource below.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Be sure to look closely at the code. It's heavily commented, but please let me know next week if there are any questions.</p>

            <h1>HOMEWORK</h1>

            <h2>SELF STUDY</h2>
            <p>To keep things moving forward, I'd like you to also review these self-study materials below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Unity's Raycasting tutorial (<a href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/physics/raycasting">link</a>)</li>
                <li>Physics Best Practices for Unity (<a href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/physics/physics-best-practices">link</a>)</li>
                <li>Unity's Introduction to Vector Math (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DK8aA2qee8">link</a>)</li>
                <li>Unity's Manual entry for the Terrain Engine (<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/script-Terrain.html">link</a>)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We'll definitely make time next week to discuss raycasting, as it is an important, but sometimes confusing, tool. However, we probably won't touch the Terrain engine in an effort to save time, so make sure that you spend some time with it this weekend and let me know if you have questions.</p>
            <p><strong>My strong suggestion</strong> would be to play with the materials in the demo, but experiment with creating a new environment using the Terrain tools.</p>

            <h2>PLAY: (DUE NEXT WEEK)</h2>
            <p>6 people each. You do not need to complete your assigned game, but please play it for at least two hours. Let's Play videos are not an acceptable substitution.</p>

                These will be set up on the PC and PS3 in the IA lounge (Log in with your MICA credentials).

            <ul>
                <li>Pick one mechanic, dynamic, or aesthetic which you feel is successfully handled by the game (please refer to <a href="http://samsheffield.com/mica/gp2s16/docs/mda.pdf">MDA framework</a> for details)</li>
                <li>Explain how your choice functions in the game and why it seems like an important, or interesting, design choice to you.</li>
                <li>Describe your experience playing this game. Does anything surprise you? How does it differ from the modern games which it inspired?</li>
                <li>250-500 words, any digital format, uploaded to class Drive.</li>
