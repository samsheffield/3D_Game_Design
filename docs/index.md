## 3D Game Design (GMD 312.01)

### About
This is the archive for 3D Game Design, taught in the Game Design program at the Maryland Institute College of Art in 2020 by Sam Sheffield (ssheffield@mica.edu). It is primarily intended for student use, but if what you find seems helpful to you, enjoy! Maybe drop me a line and say Hi.

### Course Description
In this studio course, students will build on game design and programming skills developed in 2D Game Design. Throughout the semester, students will produce small,
personally-directed game prototypes, both collaboratively and individually. Studio work will be supplemented by readings, game playthroughs, and discussions further exploring contemporary cultural issues surrounding digital games.

#### This Semester
The focus will be on prototyping and becoming familiar with Unityâ€™s 3D workflow.

#### Next Semester (Advanced 3D Game Design)
We will focus on expanding our worldbuilding toolkit and exploring more of Unity's advanced 3D features. 

### Course Goals
- Learn to design, prototype, and distribute 3D games built with Unity
- Work with in-engine & external assets such as ProBuilder, Cinemachine, and Rewired to prototype 3D games.
- Communicate & present game designs from concept to finished form.

### Student Learning Outcomes
- Students will understand how to build, test, and evaluate 3D digital games using an iterative design approach.
- Students will learn how to manage design and production in a team based environment.
- Students will analyze games as complex interactive systems.
- Students will gain skills in communicating and presenting their ideas from concept to finished form.
