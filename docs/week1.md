## Week 1 (09/03): WELCOME BACK!

### This week's goals:
So excited to welcome you all back. Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Say hello! (Where are you?? How have you been? What have you been doing?)
- Discuss this class ([Syllabus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a2Tp3C6rpy7pQO3Y5qUiDHeLsGUiowJQ/view?usp=sharing), Online class plans, and [What you'll be doing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14_FWgu5U29pK5f38UWYNuPS4vFPgcwJs/view?usp=sharing))
- Concerns, Questions? (This class, Game Design, ...uhh, Everything?!)

### Office Hours
I will be available during class time today for office hours. If you'd like to meet for any reason to discuss the semester, send me a DM on Slack or an email.

### Next Week
We will begin digging in together. We will be meeting together at 9AM EST, but if you can't make it...
- Send me an email (Letting me know why 24 hours in advance is preferred)
- Check the class Slack for links to recorded demos and other class materials

__I'll send out a Zoom meeting invite beforehand.__

### Homework (Due: Next week)
This week's homework...

#### Update Unity
Demos for this class will be made using Unity 2020.1.* (currently 2020.1.3). Please update your install using Unity Hub to make sure you don't have any issues working with demo files.

#### Survey
Take [this pre-flight survey](https://forms.gle/DzcyRCnxLJ3K5Ava7) today before you leave. It will help give me an idea of your individual needs heading into this semester.

#### Warm-up (Due next week)
When was the last time you used Unity? Let's get warmed up by creating a *very* small 2D game prototype using Unity. The thematic details, goals, and mechanics are up to you.

__Here are the technical requirements...__
- Built using Unity
- At least 2 scenes
- Basic UI (might just be a title!)
- Input through Input Manager or Rewired (not GetKey*)
- Rigidbody2D collision/trigger
- Use of sound (background or triggered samples)
- Use of IEnumerator coroutine (maybe a countdown timer?)
- Instantiated prefab (spawn something)
- Exported builds for your Mac & PC

__Deliverable__
I only want your *tested* builds (I work mostly with a PC, but I can access a Mac too). __Upload to the Warmup Prototype folder by the start of class next week.__
