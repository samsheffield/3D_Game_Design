## CLASS NOTES (11/05)

__Today...__
- Jumping
- DEMO: Improving our jump mechanic
- Prototype check-ins

__DEMO:__

Mechanics often require a lot of tuning to achieve the right feeling. Even something as common as a jump must be designed around our game's need. Today we'll make some changes to our player controller to demonstrate how we might approach one aspect of this.
- Creating a jump the responds to button press length
- Raycasting vs CharacterController.isGrounded

__DEMO MATERIALS__
Updated jump code is available [here](https://github.com/samsheffield/3D_Game_Design/releases/tag/fall20_2)

__WORK SESSION & CHECK-INS__
- How's your prototype coming along?
- Sign up for a 30 minute meeting today here
- If you can't make a meeting today, remember to share a link with me on Slack or via email later today.

__HOMEWORK__

__Complete Small Prototype 3: Keep Moving (Due next week on November 12)__

This is a two week prototype building a small 3D level around a jumping mechanic, with imported
3D assets, a mix of baked and realtime lighting, and a camera controlled using Cinemachine. Follow the process: Sketches -> greyboxing -> playable prototype

__Requirements:__
- Mechanics: Single level built around a tuned* jumping mechanic (* balanced, tweaked, and satisfying to use in the space)
- Level design: Use of 3-dimensional space to direct a player's movement (teach us how to jump in your game, then find ways to reward and challenge our use of it)
- Assets: Use of in-engine 3D primitives, ProBuilder level geometry, and at least one imported 3D model (no animation)
- Lighting: Use of baked and realtime lighting to support a specific player experience and mood you are trying to design around
- Goal: A goal clearly communicated to the player and reinforced while moving through the level. Should reward the player for achieving the goal in some way
- Control: Your prototype must be ontrollable with a gamepad

__Deliverable:__
- Uploaded playable prototype (Digital game: Win/Mac builds).
- A single playable scene and a start scene
- Build must be resettable with the R key and quittable with Esc
- Instructions!
- Make sure your prototypes include some sort of basic instruction on how to control/play. This doesn't need to be beautifully designed, but we should make sure that everyone knows the basics when they sit down to test your game for homework.

__Next Week:__

Mac and PC builds of your finished prototype need to be uploaded by the start of class next week (11/12). Work is due at this time even if you can't attend our group meeting.
