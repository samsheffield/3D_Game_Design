__3D GAME DESIGN FINAL PROJECT__

__DESCRIPTION__

For the final project in this class, you will be developing a self-defined 3D game prototype on a pre-selected 3 person team. This can be a prototype a for a small complete game or a vertical slice of a larger game.
The type of game is your choice, as long as it remains relevant to the material covered in this class, is small in scope, and is represents the shared input of the team.

- The emphasis should be on producing a well-designed and compelling game that is supported by its media.
- Reach out to me for assistance with any specific mechanics not covered in class that you are interested in exploring.
- Due December 17th @ 9am EST (Playtesting & feedback will take place during class time)

__TEAMS__
- Due to class size and difference in time zones this semester, I have decided to assign everyone to two teams.
- Your team is responsible for determining team roles, delegating tasks each week, and meeting all deliverable deadlines.

__DELIVERABLES__
- Brief game design document (Planning 1/2) demonstrating research and planning. Due 11/19
- Playable proof-of-concept and concept/key art (Planning 2/2). Due 12/03
- Playable prototype alpha (functionally complete) Due 12/10
- Uploaded build of your completed prototype (Win/Mac builds). Due 12/17
- Documentation: 3 in-game screen shots, 1 short trailer roughly 1-2 minutes in length Due 12/17

__HOMEWORK__

__PLAYTESTING & FEEDBACK FOR KEEP MOVING PROTOTYPES (DUE: NEXT WEEK)__

I have made a #keep-moving-playtesting channel for downloading builds and providing feedback.

Play each prototype and leave the following feedback as a reply in the channel:
- What is the goal of the game and how did you know?
- How was the level design of the prototype suited to the player's movement?
- What are two things that are successful or interesting about the prototype?
- What are two areas for improvement or expansion for the prototype?
- Other comments?

Due to time constraints, the feedback for this prototype will be limited to written feedback this time. No group discussion next week.

__GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT (PLANNING 1/2*)__

Create a planning document and share in each team member's class Drive folder by the start of class next week. This should include all of the following:
- A working title for your game
- Clear description of the game's concept, theme, and goals. (What is your game? What does a player do?)
- Describe your game's core mechanics through the use of compelling verbs. (Verbs? Good verbs? Yes, verbs.)
- Your game's scope. (How large is it? Does it take place in a single level? Is it a vertical slice of a larger game or a complete small game?)
- Give three precedents which are successful & relevant to the core mechanics of your game. (Explain why you chose each one)
- Clarification of each team member's expected roles.
- Schedule of your team's weekly team goals from now until 12/17.

(*2/2 will be due 12/03 and include a proof-of-concept prototype and concept art)
