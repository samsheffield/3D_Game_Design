- Three precedents which are successful & relevant to the core mechanics of your game.

__HOMEWORK (DUE 12/03)__

__CONCEPT/KEY ART & PLAYABLE PROOF OF CONCEPT PROTOTYPE  (PLANNING 2/2)__

Create the following items and share in each team member's class Drive folder by the start of next class. Include all of the following:
- A playable prototype which focuses on demonstrating how, and why, your game works. This should demonstrate what you feel is fun or exciting about your game.
- Two pieces of concept or key art which represent how your finished game will look (This concept art is a goal, so consider not only visual assets, but also UI, camera angle... everything the player will see! I recommend painting/drawing over screenshots of your prototype)
