__CLASS NOTES 09/10__  
Today...  
- Rolling Ball Demo 1 (Working with 3D primitives, materials, player movement, camera following player, and trigger collision)
- Intro to Greyboxing

__DEMO 1 (Approx 45 Minutes)__  
Recordings of today's in-class demo can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL42xm44H83rJWDJNLTa2uIx_3vjdQI-xk)

__GREYBOXING__
Greyboxing is the term used for a process used by game developers to quickly get a sense of the spatial relationships, and test mechanics and game feel within a game. It is often used in the creation of 3D videogames because of the costly nature of 3D asset development, but it is a common low risk, low cost approach to design 2D videogames as well. Greyboxing is also sometimes referred to as whiteboxing or blocking out.

__Greyboxing is...__
- Quick
- Easy to implement
- Functional, not aesthetic
- Used to test and answer questions
- Not precious

__Game design is an iterative process__

__HOMEWORK 1__

__Building Blocks (DUE IN TWO WEEKS (09/24), First Pass at Greybox NEXT WEEK)__  
Using only Unity's built-in 3D primitives, create a fun & challenging single level prototype using the ball rolling prototypes demoed in class over the next two weeks.

__Technical requirements:__

- Sketches -> greybox -> playable prototype.
- Use of in-engine 3D primitives
- Use of colored materials for your game's assets.
- Level must have a clear goal.
- Level must have conflict/challenging component (This doesn't mean punishing!)
- Use of one UI element (Timer, score, etc. I can provide a small working example of these for you to use)

__Some possible inspiration:__
- Mini Golf and Croquet
- Pinball or Bumper pool
- Marble Madness (1984)
- Super Monkey Ball(2001)
- Odama (2006)
- Rock of Ages (2011)
- Katamari Damacy
- Marble Mania (ROBLOX game)

__Next Week:__  
Have your first pass at a greyboxed level ready to discuss next week (09/17). __If you can't be here in person, please upload a PC build of your greyboxed level to your Google Drive folder by the start of class next week. Include a short written statement describing what you are trying to accomplish.__

__Two Weeks:__  
The finished prototypes  will be uploaded at the start of class in two weeks (09/24).
  
__HOMEWORK 2__

__Written Game Response (Due 09/17)__  

You have two options. __Choose one!__:
-- Option 1: Classic 3D Game Response
-- Option 2: Personal Classic 3D Game Response

__ Option 1__
Play one of these two early 3D videogames (1 hour minimum) and write a brief response to it:  
- Describe your experience playing this game. Does anything surprise you? How does it differ from the modern games which it inspired?
- Try to focus on specific game design choices that you feel contribute in meaningful (even if negative) ways to the game playing experience.

__Option 2__
Choose one of the first 3D videogames which you remember playing and write a brief response to it:
- Try to play the game again, but if not watch some videos to help you recall specific details.
- Describe your experience playing this game. Does anything surprise you? How does it differ from the modern games which it inspired?
- Try to focus on specific game design choices that you feel contribute in meaningful (even if negative) ways to the game playing experience.

__Next Week:__  
A digital document needs to be shared to your Gogle Drive folder by the start of class next week (09/17). I'm not particularly interested in grammar or spelling, but please focus on clearly communicating your ideas and reach out the LRC if you need writing assistance. You can choose the length (or if you can't, you can just write a page!)
