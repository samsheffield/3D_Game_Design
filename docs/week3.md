__CLASS NOTES 09/17__  
Today...  
- Lights, Camera Demo 2 (Setting up cameras and introduction to basic lights)
- Orbiting Camera script (via excellent Catlike Coding Movement tutorials)
- Work session & individual check-ins

__DEMO 2 (Approx 45 Minutes)__  
Recordings of today's in-class demo can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL42xm44H83rIdB9bK6TIDwjYFswEx0wuH)

__ORBITING CAMERA__
Catlike Coding has a really in-depth (and excellent) tutorial on creating a controllable orbiting camera. The finished script is quite robust and also less fussy/complex than using Cinemachine's FreeLook Camera (which we'll use later this semester!)
- Tutorial is [here](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/movement/orbit-camera/)
- [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fkhjoshJ9J6ovPXICcwFYb72NCmuikA0/view?usp=sharing) is just the .cs script

__Note: You will need to create Horizontal Camera and Vertical Camera entries in your project's Input Manager for this to work:__  
"I defined Vertical Camera and Horizontal Camera input axes for this, bound to the third and fourth axis, the ijkl and qe keys, and the mouse with sensitivity increased to 0.5."

__WORK SESSION & CHECK-INS__
How's your prototype coming along?
- Sign up for a 15 minute meeting today [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wd0XReuDixfhPCACWacBfAbi-cvRaeCcXrN1RHIn23c/edit?usp=sharing)
- If you can't make a meeting today, remember to share a link with me on Slack or via email later today.

__NEXT WEEK__
- Group meeting @ 9 AM EST
- Talk about early 3D games & their design
- First person perspective
- Discuss weekend prototype playtesting format

__HOMEWORK 1__

__Building Blocks (DUE NEXT WEEK (09/24))__  
Using only Unity's built-in 3D primitives, create a fun & challenging single level prototype using the ball rolling prototypes demoed in class over the next two weeks.

__Technical requirements:__

- Sketches -> greybox -> playable prototype.
- Use of in-engine 3D primitives
- Use of colored materials for your game's assets.
- Level must have a clear goal.
- Level must have conflict/challenging component (This doesn't mean punishing!)
- Use of one UI element (Timer, score, etc. I can provide a small working example of these for you to use)

__Next Week:__   
Mac and PC builds of your finished prototype need to be uploaded by the start of class next week (09/24).
