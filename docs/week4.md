Let's take a look at your two week prototypes together.

__Demo 3 (Approx. 1 hour)__  
Recordings of today's in-class demos can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL42xm44H83rIC-IhhYhQMm8gyuUpd8-pF).

__More on ProBuilder next week__  
We'll demo some useful ProBuilder things next week, but [here's something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBa_opm3_GM) you might find helpful in the meantime

__HOMEWORK 1__  
__Begin Personal Space Prototype (Due in two weeks on  10/15, first pass at greyboxing due next week)__  
Use ProBuilder and Unity's 3D primitives to build a prototype of a small interior 3D environment, explored and interacted with in first person perspective. The player's goal is to reach a destination through environmental cues.

__Requirements:__
Sketches -> greyboxing -> playable prototype
Use of in-engine 3D primitives and ProBuilder level geometry
First person character controller and camera
At least one meaningful type of interaction
A single playable scene and a start scene
Build must be resettable with the R key and quittable with Esc
An interior space
A destination communicated through cues in the space as the goal

__HOMEWORK 2__  
__Written Game Response 2 (Due next week, 10/08)__  

Two choices:
- Portal ($9.99 USD on Steam)
- Dear Esther ($9.99 USD online)
* Please let me know if playing one of these games is financially challenging for you.  

Play at least 2 hours of either game. Then, in writing...
- Describe your experience playing the game. What was notable?
- How did the game use environmental cues and level design to communicate goals with the player? (where to go, what to do, etc.)  
Try to focus on specific game design choices that contributed in meaningful ways to your game playing experience.

__Next Week:__  
A digital document needs to be shared to your Google Drive folder by the start of class next week (09/17). I’m not particularly interested in grammar or spelling, but please focus on clearly communicating your ideas and reach out the LRC if you need writing assistance. You can choose the length (or if you can’t, you can just write a page!)
