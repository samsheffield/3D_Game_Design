## CLASS NOTES 10/08
Today...
- ProBuilder Demo  (Flipping normals, working from a floor plan, vertex colors, setting materials, collision/trigger volumes)
- Work session & individual check-ins

__DEMO 2 (Approx 45 Minutes)__
Today's in-class demo inspired by [this Unity tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYBOBgfcTgY)

__WORK SESSION & CHECK-INS__ 
- How's your prototype coming along?
- Sign up for a 15 minute meeting today here
- If you can't make a meeting today, remember to share a link with me on Slack or via email later today.

__NEXT WEEK__
- Group meeting @ 9 AM EST
- Discuss weekend prototype playtesting format

__HOMEWORK__

- Begin Personal Space Prototype (Due next week on  10/15)
- Use ProBuilder and Unity's 3D primitives to build a prototype of a small interior 3D environment, explored and interacted with in first person perspective. The player's goal is to reach a destination through environmental cues.

__Requirements:__
- Sketches -> greyboxing -> playable prototype
- Use of in-engine 3D primitives and ProBuilder level geometry
- First person character controller and camera
- At least one meaningful type of interaction
- A single playable scene and a start scene
- Build must be resettable with the R key and quittable with Esc
- An interior space
- A destination communicated through cues in the space as the goal
- Instructions!

__Also__

Make sure your prototypes include some sort of basic instruction on how to control/play. This doesn't need to be beautifully designed, but we should make sure that everyone knows the basics when they sit down to test your game for homework.

__Next Week:__

Mac and PC builds of your finished prototype need to be uploaded by the start of class next week (10/15). Work is due at this time even if you can't attend our group meeting.
