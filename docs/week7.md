## CLASS NOTES 10/15
__TODAY__
- Discuss how Portal directs & challenges players
- Exporting .fbx models from Blender to Unity
- Personal Space playtesting session

__GROUP DISCUSSION__

We will break into small breakout groups to discuss the games you responded to for homework last week. Then, we'll share experiences as a group while playing through some of the early levels together.

__Discussion points__

- What is something you found interesting, fun, or challenging about this game? Choose one memorable moment to share with the class.
- What is a design choice that positively influenced your experience playing the game? Choose one to share as a group.

__Exporting an .fbx from Blender to use in Unity__

Today, we'll begin discussing how to get 3D models into Unity and some of its related quirks.  Here's a [playlist for today's demo](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL42xm44H83rIsdjnU-dHL8bW-0mLC1_9k).

__CLASSWORK/HOMEWORK__
__1. Leave Personal Space playtesting feedback for each game (DUE: Next Week)__

I have made a #personal-space-playtesting channel for downloading builds and providing feedback.

Play each prototype and leave the following feedback as a reply in the channel:
- What is the goal of the game and how did you know?
- How was the level design of the protoype direct you toward your goal?
- What are two things that are successful or interesting about the prototype?
- What are two areas for improvement or expansion for the prototype?
- Other comments?

__2. Importing .fbx files to Unity (+ Blender Introduction self study)__

For homework, I'd like you to practice importing non-animated 3D models into Unity in the following two ways:

Find a free low-poly asset pack from Unity and import it to your Unity project
- Export a 3D model from Blender** to Unity (** If you are already familiar with a different 3D modeling application, you can use that instead)

I would like you to spend some time getting familiar with the workflow using your 3D modeling application of choice. (I recommend Blender). 
- The official Blender Fundamentals 2.8 playlist on YouTube is a good starting place. (You can focus on videos 1-15). For exporting, take a look at [the playlist for today's demo](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL42xm44H83rIsdjnU-dHL8bW-0mLC1_9k).
- As an exercise, I suggest building an object in Blender to replace the greyboxed object from your Personal Space prototype. Use your GameObject's properties as a guide for your design in Blender.  Good luck!

__Next Week__

- Discuss your prototypes as a group
- Individual midterm progress meetings (A signup sheet will be posted by the start of class next week.)
