## CLASS NOTES 10/22

__TODAY__
- 1-on-1 midterm meetings

__A LITTLE REST THIS WEEK__

Let's take some time this week to recharge. Take a break, make something for fun, spend some more time with Blender. It's your time!

__MIDTERM MEETINGS_

I've set up a schedule for 20 minute check-in meetings today:

We'll talk about...
1. How you are doing in class so far (quality of work, participation in class, any missing work)
2. Your successes in this class so far and areas for improvement moving forward
3. Your perspective on how the class is going for you so far.

__HOMEWORK__

__Written Game Response (Due 10/29)__

Choose a contemporary or classic 3D platformer game* and write a brief response to it:
- If this is a game you've played before, please play it again with your game designer glasses on.
- Describe your experience playing this game. Does anything surprise you? How does it differ from the modern games which it inspired?
- Try to focus on specific game design choices that you feel contribute in meaningful (even if negative) ways to the game playing experience.

__Next Week:__

A digital document needs to be shared to your Google Drive folder by the start of class next week (10/29). 
- Iâ€™m not particularly interested in grammar or spelling, but please focus on clearly communicating your ideas and reach out the LRC if you need writing assistance. One page minimum.
