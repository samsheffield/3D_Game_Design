__HOMEWORK__

__Begin Small Prototype 3: Keep Moving (Due in two weeks on November 12)__

This is a two week prototype building a small 3D level around a jumping mechanic, with imported
3D assets, a mix of baked and realtime lighting, and a camera controlled using Cinemachine. Follow the process: Sketches -> greyboxing -> playable prototype

__Requirements:__
- Mechanics: Single level built around a tuned* jumping mechanic (* balanced, tweaked, and satisfying to use in the space)
- Level design: Use of 3-dimensional space to direct a player's movement (teach us how to jump in your game, then find ways to reward and challenge our use of it)
- Assets: Use of in-engine 3D primitives, ProBuilder level geometry, and at least one imported 3D model (no animation)
- Lighting: Use of baked and realtime lighting to support a specific player experience and mood you are trying to design around
- Goal: A goal clearly communicated to the player and reinforced while moving through the level. Should reward the player for achieving the goal in some way
- Control: Your prototype must be ontrollable with a gamepad

__Deliverable:__
- Uploaded playable prototype (Digital game: Win/Mac builds).
- A single playable scene and a start scene
- Build must be resettable with the R key and quittable with Esc

__Some inspiration:__
- Alpha Waves
- Super Mario 64 (or other Mario 3D games)
- Jumping Flash!
- Sonic Adventure
- Bound
- Spyro the Dragon
- Ratchet & Clank
- Grow Home

__Next Week:__

Have your first pass at a greyboxed level ready to discuss next week (11/05). If you canâ€™t be here in person, please upload a PC build of your greyboxed level to your Google Drive folder by the start of class next week. Include a short written statement describing what you are trying to accomplish.
